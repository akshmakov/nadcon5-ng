In order for all programs to execute properly, the following lines 
must be added to the shell's startup configuration file; 
note that the programs will run in either CSH or BASH:

---------   .cshrc  -----------------
# Increase thread stack size to 100MB
setenv STACKSIZE 102400
# Increase main stack size to 2048 MB
limit stacksize 2097148
# - Ask for 4 CPU's to be used by parallel programs
setenv PARALLEL 4

---------   .bashrc  -----------------
# Increase thread stack size to 100MB
export STACKSIZE=102400
# Increase main stack size to 2048 MB
ulimit -s 2097148
# - Ask for 4 CPU's to be used by parallel programs
export PARALLEL=4
