>>> README for directory /20160901release/RunNADCON5 <<

This directory contains all the code necessary to generate
NADCON 5.0 transformations, start to finish. The directory 
is structured so that a user can copy the full directory tree 
to a local UNIX machine, compile the code using the provided 
helper script, then run the code to generate NADCON 5.0 results. 

The directory is structured as follows:

/RunNADCON5
/RunNADCON5/Boundaries		boundaries of continents, islands, and states,
				  used for drawing maps
/RunNADCON5/Code		all code needed to generate transformations
/RunNADCON5/Control		files which group realizations into 
				  regional grids
/RunNADCON5/Data		supporting grid and boundary files
/RunNADCON5/InFiles		fundamental data files (lat/lon/eht of points)
/RunNADCON5/Masks		code and mask explicitly used when building the HARN to
                                  FBN transformation in CONUS, due to that transformation
                                  being non-zero in only 19 states.
/RunNADCON5/Work/workedits	list of points marked for exclusion (outliers)

The base directory contains this README, as well as the "doit" and "undoit" 
scripts necessary to generate a NADCON 5.0 build (see below).

Note that the base directory also contains a hidden file: 
".gmtdefaults" (with leading period).
By using this file, the resulting plots will use the same plotting
conventions as graphics in the NADCON 5.0 report and digital archive. 
If the .gmtdefaults file is hidden, the file "gmtdefaults" should be 
renamed to ".gmtdefaults" to insure proper plotting.


========= Generating NADCON 5.0 Products =================

To generate NADCON 5.0 products from scratch, follow this procedure
in sequence:

SETUP:
- Create a working directory on your local machine
  where you want to run NADCON 5.0. For the remainder of this list, 
  this directory will be referred to as [LOCAL].
- Install Generic Mapping Tools and add it to your UNIX path
        http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/projects/gmt/wiki/Download
        http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/projects/gmt/wiki/Installing
- Copy the full contents of the /RunNADCON5 directory
  to [LOCAL]. Be sure to copy recursively as there are many
  subdirectories.
- Verify that [LOCAL]/.gmtdefaults exists (note the leading period in
  the filename). If this file does not exist, rename "gmtdefaults"
  to ".gmtdefaults".
- Set up shell variables as specified in /RunNADCON5/Code/README
- Change directory to [LOCAL]/Code 
- Execute 'compileCode' to generate executable programs;
  if you do not have the "f95" compiler on your machine and in
  your UNIX path, you will need to install "f95" or change the
  compiler used by 'compileCode'

EXECUTION:
- Change directory [LOCAL]
- For each transformation you wish to generate, run the "doit"
  commands in sequence (doit.bat, doit2.bat, doit3.bat, doit4.bat), waiting for
  each one to execute before proceeding to the next. Additional
  detail on the syntax options for each "doit" command and
  the grid sizes used to generate specific NADCON 5.0 products
  are given in the NADCON 5.0 Report.

HOW the Mask is applied:
- The directory /Masks, contains all of the information needed to create a 
  special mask grid (mask.harnfbn.30.b) which is used exclusively in the 
  creation of the transformation from NAD 83(HARN) to NAD 83(FBN) in CONUS.  
  It is applied *automatically* by the "doit" routines whenever they are 
  invoked with od/nd/rg = "nad83_harn"/"nad83_fbn"/"conus".  The user need
  not do anything special to invoke the use of this mask.  Details about
  its use can be found in sections 4.3.1 and especially 6.1.4 of the
  NADCON 5.0 report.
